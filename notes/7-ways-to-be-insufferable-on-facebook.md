## Overview

A Facebook status is annoying if it primarily serves the author and does nothing positive for anyone reading it. To be unannoying, a Facebook status typically has to be one of two things, which do something for me, the reader.

1. Interesting/Informative
2. Funny/Amusing/Entertaining

On the other hand, annoying statuses typically reek of one or more of these five motivations:

1. **Image Crafting**. The author wants to affect the way people think of her.
2. **Narcissism**. The author’s thoughts, opinions, and life philosophies matter. The author and the author’s life are interested in and of themselves.
3. **Attention Craving**. The author wants attention.
4. **Jealousy Inducing**. The author wants to make people jealous of him or his life.
5. **Loneliness**. The author is feeling lonely and wants Facebook to make it better. This is the least heinous of the five—but seeing a lonely person acting lonely on Facebook makes me and everyone else sad. So the person is essentially spreading their sadness, and that’s a shitty thing to do, so it’s on the list.

## Wrap-up

There’s no dislike button or eye-roll button or middle finger button on Facebook, and it’s a bad form to be too much of a dick in the comments below a status. So annoying statuses are just positively reinforced, and people remain un-self-aware that they regularly bring down the quality of everyone else’s life.

The bigger point here is that the qualities of annoying statuses are normal human qualities. Everyone needs to brag to someone here and there, everyone has moments of weakness when they need attention or feel lonely, and everyone has some downright ugly qualities that are gonna come out at one time or another.

**And that’s why you have people who love you.**

The thing that most others haven’t internalized is the fact that if they have 800 Facebook friends, only about 10 or 15 love them. For an especially lovable person, maybe it’s as high as 30. Between 1 and 4%. That means that **between 96 and 99% of your Facebook friends DO NOT LOVE YOU**.
