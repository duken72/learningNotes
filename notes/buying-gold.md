-------

Firstly, define your purpose of buying gold? Make profit or for saving? What is your finance condition?

- If you have multiple sources of income and good finance condition, go for gold bar (wait until the price is stable, avoid buying when the price hits peak). However, real estate would be more profitable than gold.
- If your finance condition is mediocre (100-200M VND), you might consider buying gold for long term saving (1-3 years), then go for the type of gold with the price closest to world price. Aware then the price of gold bar is above 15mil in comparison with world price.

1. The difference between SJC gold bar and gold ring and their price deviation?\
   - Both types are 24k gold, which are 99.99% pure.
   - The price deviation is due to the fact that gold bars have national brand and are produced in limited number. Their buying and exchanging demand is high, thus the price varies.
   - Gold rings are not constrained in numbers produced. Thus, the price is closer with world's price.
   - If the price difference is small (2-3mil VND), then go for gold bars. They would be easier to trade and are more valuable.
   - If the price difference is large (15-16mil VND), then go for gold rings. They are more stable and less risky.
2. Could you choose the gold weight?\
  (26 taels and 6 maces is equivalent to 997.5 gram)
  Depending on your income to decide the amount to buy. It's better to buy often (once every month) than but a large amount every once a while, since the price varies monthly.
   - SJC gold bars types:
     - 5 mace ("chỉ")
     - 1 tael ("lượng" ~ "cây")
     - 1 kg (maybe)
   - 9999 gold bar types:
     - 1, 2, 5 maces (SJC stores)
     - 1, 2 taels (private stores)  
3. Buy gold now or wait until the price drops for saving?\
  The price often varies, thus don't wait too long, it might actually never really go down.
4. Make profit from trading gold?\
  Maybe, and only with gold bars, if you buy at good price.
5. Difference between SJC gold rings and ones from private store\
  SJC gold rings tend to be 99.99% pure. While privately manufactured gold rings usually are just 98% or 98.5%.
6. Is the handcraft cost included?\
  Gold bars or gold rings has minimum handcraft cost, unless produced by special designs. For saving, just don't buy jewelry as it will be difficult for trading.
7. Buy gold with cash or card? Bank transaction? Where to reference the price?
   - If you have car, bring cash, it is safer and faster for transaction. If you have motorbike, it's obviously too risky to bring cash.
   - You could go to the store, chose the gold type and payout with bank transaction, it might be safer and more convenience, though more time-consuming. Don't forget to check your daily bank transaction limit.
   - All gold stores won't accept wiping card, because they have to pay the bank a fee.

8. Keeping gold in rented house or in the bank?\
  Is it safe? Currently, there are 12 banks (in VN) keep private gold with charge. It's worth considering to keep the gold there.

  Buy gold. Through time, paper money always looses value, while gold gains in value.
