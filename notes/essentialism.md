## The Essence of an Essentialist

1. Choose

    The ability to choose cannot be taken away or even given away - it can only be forgotten.

    | NONESSENTIALIST | ESSENTIALIST |
    | -- | -- |
    | I have to | I choose to |
    | Forfeits the right to choose | Exercises the power of choice |
2. Discern

    > You can not overestimate the unimportance of practically everything (John Maxwell)

    | NONESSENTIALIST | ESSENTIALIST |
    | -- | -- |
    | Thinks almost everything is essential | Thinks almost everything is nonessential |
    | Views opportunities as basically equal | Distinguishes the vital few from the trivial many |
3. Trade-off

    > There are no solutions. There are only trade-offs. (Thomas Sowell)

    - The reality is, saying yes to any opportunity by definition requires saying no to several others.
    - We can try to avoid the reality of trade-offs, but we can't escape them

    | NONESSENTIALIST | ESSENTIALIST |
    | -- | -- |
    | Thinks, "I can do both" | Asks, "What is the trade-off I want to make?" |
    | Asks, "How can I do it all?" | Asks, "What can I go big on?" |

    | -- | -- |
    | Is too busy doing to think about life | Creates space to escape and explore life |
2. Look

    Some people listen while preparing to say something. They get distracted by extraneous noise. They hyperfocus on inconsequential details. They hear the loudest voice, but they get the wrong message.
    - Try to see the Big Picture
    - Filter for the Fascinating
    - Keep a Journal
    - Get Out into the Field
    - Keep your eyes peeled for abnormal or unusual details
    - Clarify the Question

    | NONESSENTIALIST | ESSENTIALIST |
    | -- | -- |
    | Pays attention to the loudest voice | Pays attention to the signal in the noise |
    | Hears everything being said | Hears what is **NOT** being said |
    | Is overwhelmed by all the information | Scans to find the essence of the information |
3. Play: Play doesn't just help us to explore what is essential. It ***IS*** essential in and of itself.
    > A little nonsense now and then, is cherished by the wisest men. (Roald Dahl)

    | NONESSENTIALIST **THINKS** | ESSENTIALIST **KNOWS** |
    | -- | -- |
    | Play is trivial | Play is essential |
    | Play is an unproductive waste of time | Play sparks exploration |
4. Sleep
    | NONESSENTIALIST **THINKS** | ESSENTIALIST **KNOWS** |
    | -- | -- |
    | One hour less of sleep equals one more hour of productivity | One hour more of sleep equals several more hours of much higher productivity |
    | Sleep is for failures | Sleep is for high performers |
    | Sleep is a luxury | Sleep is a priority |
    | Sleep breeds laziness | Sleep breeds creativity |
    | Sleep gets in the way of "doing it all" | Sleep enables the highest levels of mental contribution |
5. Select: If it isn't a clear YES, then it's a clear NO.
    > If the answer isn't a definite YES then it should be a NO. (a leader at Twitter)

    | NONESSENTIALIST | Essentialist |
    | -- | -- |
    | Says YES to almost every request and opportunity | Says YES to only the top 10 percent of opportunity |
    | Uses broad, implicit criteria | Uses narrow, explicit criteria |

## Leadership Essentials

### Essentialist Teams

|  | NONESSENTIALIST | ESSENTIALIST |
|---|---|---|
| MIND-SET | Everything to everyone | Less but better |
| TALENT | Hires people frantically and creates a "Bozo explosion" | Ridiculously selective on talent and removes people who hold the team back |
| STRATEGY | Pursues a straddled strategy where everything is a priority | Defines an essential intent by answering the question, "If we could only do one thing, what would it be?" Eliminates the nonessential distractions. |
| EMPOWERMENT | Allows ambiguity over who is doing what. Decisions are capricious | Focuses on each team member's highest role and goal of contribution |
| COMMUNICATION | Talks in code | Listens to get to what is essential |
| ACCOUNTABILITY | Checks in too much or is so busy to checks out altogether. Sometimes does both: disrupting the focus of the group and then being absent to the group | Checks in with people in a gentle way to see how he/she can remove obstacles and enable small wins |
| RESULT | A fractured team that makes a millimeter of progress in a million directions | A unified team that breaks through to the next level of contribution |

## Other Notes

### The Paradox of Success

*The pursuit of success* **CAN BE** a *catalyst for failure*.

**Phase 1:** When we really have clarity of purpose, it enables us to succeed at our endeavor.

**Phase 2:** When we have success, we gain a reputation as a "go to" person. We become "good old [insert name]", who is always there when you need him, and we are presented with increased options and opportunities.

**Phase 3:** When we have increased options and opportunities, which is actually coded for demands upon or time and energies, it leads to diffused efforts. We get spread thinner and thinner.

**Phase 4:** We become distracted from what would otherwise be our highest level of contribution. The effect of our success has been to undermine the very clarity that led to our success in the first place.

-------

### Why Nonessentialism is Everywhere?

- Too many choices
- Too much social pressure
- The idea that "You can have it all"

-------

### Learned Helplessness

E.g.: a child who struggles early on with mathematics. He tries and tries but never gets any better, so eventually he gives up. He believes nothing he does will matter.

-------

### Straddling

Keeping your existing strategy intact while simultaneously also trying to adopt the strategy of a competitor.

-------

### Essential Intent

|  | General | Concrete |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Inspirational | Vision/Mission | Essential Intent |
| Bland | Values | Quarterly Objective |

E.g.:

- "We want to change the world": inspirational, but is so general they are almost entirely ignored.
- "Innovation, Leadership and Teamwork": bland, general, vague, too generic to inspire any passion.
- "Increase profit by 5% by last year's results": concrete but lack inspiration.
- "To get everyone in the U.K. online by the end of 2012": simple, concrete and easily measured.

-------

### The "No" Repertoire

1. The awkward pause\
    Just pause for a moment, before delivering your verdict. Or simply wait for the other person to fill the void.
2. The soft "no" (or the "no but")\
    I am consumed with ... But I would love to get together once/after ...
3. "Let me check my calendar and get back to you"
4. Use email bouncebacks
5. Say, "Yes. What should I deprioritize?"
6. Say it with humor
7. Use the words "You are welcome to X. I am willing to Y."\
    E.g.: You are welcome to borrow my car. I am willing to make sure the keys are here for you.
8. "I can't do it, but X might be interested."\
    Often, the people requesting something don't really care if we're the ones who help them - as long as they get the help.

-------

### The Sunk-Cost Bias

Sunk-cost bias is the tendency to continue to invest time, money, or energy into something we know is a losing proposition simply because we have already incurred, or sunk, a cost that cannot be recouped.

-------

### Multitasking Versus Multifocusing

We can easily do two things at the same time: wash the dishes and listen to the radio, eat and talk, etc. But we can't *concentrate* on two things at the same time.
