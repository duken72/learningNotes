## Basics Understanding

Using these techniques correctly relies on two key principles.

- “Closed World” principle
- Function Follows Form

### Closed World

- Closed World is the physical space and time immediately surrounding you. Within this space, you have components and elements within your reach.
- The notion that the best and fastest way to innovate is to look at resources close at hand.

### Function Follows Form

- Most people assume that the way to innovate is to start with a well-defined problem and then try to think of solutions.
- However, people are actually better at searching for benefits for given configurations (starting with a solution) than they are at finding the best configuration for a given benefit.
- With these techniques, it is the opposite. We start with an abstract, conceptual solution and then work back to the problem that it solves.
- It doesn’t make logical sense—at first. This sets the stage for using function follows form: connecting the seemingly strange configuration to an innovative and useful new concept.

### BLINDED BY FIXEDNESS

- *Structural Fixedness* refers to our tendency to believe that objects or systems can be made (structured) only as they have traditionally been made.
- *Functional Fixedness* refers to our tendency to believe that each component should be used in only its current role.

### The Five Basic Steps

1. List the product's or service's internal components.
2. Varied with each technique.
3. Visualize the resulting concept (no matter how strange it seems).
4. Ask:
   - What are the potential benefits, markets, and values? Who would want this new product or service, and why would they find it valuable?
   - If you are trying to solve a specific problem, how can it help address that particular challenge?
5. If you decide that this new product or service is valuable, then ask:
   - Is it feasible? Can you actually create these new products? Perform these new services?
   - Why or why not? Is there any way to refine or adapt the idea to make it more viable?

### The Brainstorming Myth

In 1953 Alex Osborn, a founder and manager at an advertising agency, coined the term. However, after research, there was no advantage to a brainstorming group over a group of the same number of individuals working alone. The brainstorming group:

- Came up with fewer ideas than individuals working alone.
- Generated ideas with lower quality / creativity.
- Was optimal with about four participants.

Reasons:

- Noise interrupts individuals' train of thought.
- Some people are "free riders", who make no contribution.
- Fear of criticism.

## The Subtraction Technique

When Less Becomes More.
> A shortcut to riches is to subtract from our desires — Petrarch

### HOW TO USE SUBTRACTION

- The 2nd step: Select and essential component and imagine removing it. There are two ways:
  - Full subtraction. The entire component is removed.
  - Partial subtraction. Take one of the features or functions of the component away or diminish it in some way.
- The 4th step: Ask:
  - After you’ve considered the concept “as is” (without that essential component), try replacing the function with something from the *Closed World* (but not with the original component). You can replace the component with either an internal or an external component.
  - What are the potential benefits, markets, and values of the revised concept?

### COMMON PITFALLS IN USING SUBTRACTION

- Don’t just take out troublesome components.
- Try taking out essential components.
- Avoid immediately replacing the subtracted component.
- Don’t succumb to cognitive dissonance.
- Avoid simple “unbundling.”

## The Division Technique

Divide and Conquer.
> Life proceeds not by the association and addition of elements, but by dissociation and division — Henri Bergson

### HOW TO USE DIVISION

The 2nd step: Divide the product or service in one of three ways:

- Functional (take a component and rearrange its location or when it appears).
- Physical (cut the product or one of its components along any physical line and rearrange it).
- Preserving (divide the product or service into smaller pieces, with each piece still possessing all the characteristics of the whole).

### COMMON PITFALLS IN USING DIVISION

- Rearrange divided components in both space and time.
- Notice how starting with a component list is a form of Division.
- Change “resolution” if you are having trouble. Think of Resolution as your distance from the Closed World.

-------

## The Multiplication Technique

Be Fruitful and Multiply.
> Opportunities multiply as they are seized — Sun Tzu

### HOW TO USE MULTIPLICATION

The 2nd step: Select a component and make copies of it. (If you’re unsure how many, simply select an arbitrary number of copies.)

- For that component, make a list of its attributes. Attributes are the characteristics of the component that could change, and can include color, location, style, temperature, the number and type of people involved, and so on.
- Change one of the essential attributes of the copies. Essential means that the attribute is associated directly with what the component does. Be sure to change it in a non-obvious, counterintuitive way.

### COMMON PITFALLS IN USING MULTIPLICATION

- Don’t simply add something new to a product or service.
- When multiplying a component, be sure to change it.
- Avoid just copying an attribute.
- Try making multiple copies of a component, not just one.

## The Task Unification Technique

New Tricks for Old Dogs
> What we are familiar with, we cease to see - Anaïs Nin

### HOW TO USE TASK UNIFICATION

- The 1st step: List all components, both internal and external, that are part of the Closed World of the product, service, or process.
- The 2nd step: Select a component from the list. Assign it an additional task, using one of three methods:
  - Outsourcing: Choose an external component and use it to perform a task that the product accomplishes already (example: iPhone app developers).
  - Making the Most of Your Existing Internal Resources: Choose an internal component and make it do something new or extra (example: John Doyle’s actor-musicians).
  - Inside Out: Choose an internal component and make it perform the function of an external component, effectively “stealing” the external component’s function (example: Tales of Things heirlooms keeping the family history).

### COMMON PITFALLS IN USING TASK UNIFICATION

- Don’t “play it safe” by assigning new tasks only to components that are obviously up for the job
- Make sure you identify the obvious components in the Closed World.
- Don’t confuse aggregating or changing functions with assigning new ones.
- Apply the Task Unification Technique all three possible ways.

## The Attribute Dependency Technique

Clever Correlations
> If there is one unchanging theme that runs throughout these separate stories, it is that everything changes but change itself - John F. Kennedy

### HOW TO USE ATTRIBUTE DEPENDENCY

1. Make a list of variables.
2. Assign variables to columns and rows.
3. Fill in the table based on current market dynamics.
4. Fill in the table based on possible dependencies.
5. [Step 4](#the-five-basic-steps)
6. [Step 5](#the-five-basic-steps)

### COMMON PITFALLS IN USING ATTRIBUTE DEPENDENCY

- Don’t mix up components and variables.
- Take the time to make a proper table.
- Once you choose a cell, try different dependency types.
- Create dependencies only between what you can control.

-------

## CONTRADICTION: A PATH TO CREATIVITY

- A contradiction exists when a particular situation contains features or ideas that are connected yet directly opposed to one another. It most commonly occurs in the form of (1) a demand for a benefit or advantage, and (2) the cost of providing that benefit or advantage.
- A False Contradiction occurs when information is hidden from you or when you make an implicit assumption that isn’t true. We need to separate true contradictions from false contradictions\
  E.g.: "All Cretans are liars." - a famous Cretan philosopher.\
  Hidden implicit assumption: Liar lies in every statement.
- The “NO COMPROMISE!” rule in creative problem-solving. Anyone can come up with a compromise.
