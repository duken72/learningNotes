## The Rich Don't Work for Money

- The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them.
- Life is the best teacher of all. Most of the time, life does not talk to you. It just sort of pushes you around. If you learn life’s lessons, you will do well. Some people give up and just let life push them around. Others get angry and fight back, but against their boss, their job, their husband and wife. A few learn the lesson and move on. They welcome life pushing them around. To these few people, it means they need and want to learn something. They learn and move on.
- It's fear that keeps most people working at a job: the fear of not paying their bills, the fear of being fired, the fear of not having enough money, and the fear of starting over. That’s the price of studying to learn a profession or trade, and then working for money. Most people become a slave to money and then get angry at their boss.
- Most people have a price. And they have a price because of human emotions named fear and greed. First, the fear of being without money motivates us to work hard, and then once we get that paycheck, greed or desire starts us thinking about all the wonderful things money can buy. The pattern is then set. The pattern of get up, go to work, pay bills. People’s lives are forever controlled by two emotions: fear and greed. Offer them more money, and they continue the cycle by increasing their spending. That's the Rat Race.

## Finance Literacy

- Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire liabilities that they think are assets.
- The house is a liability, and if your house is your largest investment, you're in trouble.
- An asset puts money in my pocket. A liability takes money out of my pocket.
- The rich focus on their asset columns while everyone else focuses on their income statements. Real assets fall into the following categories:
  - Businesses that do not require my presence
  - Stocks
  - Bonds
  - Income-generating real estate
  - Notes (IOUs)
  - Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts, and patents
  - Anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates, and has a ready market
