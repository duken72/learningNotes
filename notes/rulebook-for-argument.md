## Short Arguments

1. Identify premises & conclusion
2. Develop ideas in a natural order\
   Try to rearrange your argument (sentence), see what is best
3. Start with reliable, certain, strong premises.\
   (common, well-known evidence)
4. Concrete & concise: less is more (reread what you wrote)
5. Build on substance, not overtone\
   When you are writing, leave your emotion aside.\
   When you are reading someone's work, try to figure out underneath their emotionally loaded words.
6. Use consistent terms
   - 1 -> 2. 2' -> 3. => 1' => 3'. Loose connection
   - 1 -> 2. 2 -> 3. => 1 -> 3. Not so stylish, but it's crystal clear

-------

## Generalization

1. Use more than one example
2. Use representative examples
3. Background rates maybe crucial:
   <font size="4">$\frac{\#successes}{\#tries}$</font>
4. Statistic needs critical eye
5. Consider counter examples

-------

## Arguments by Analogy

1. Analogies require relevantly similar examples

-------

## Sources

1. Cite our sources
2. Seek informed sources
3. Seek impartial sources: independent, unbiased
4. Cross-check sources
5. Use the Web with care

-------

## Arguments about Causes

1. Causal arguments start with correlations
2. Correlation may have alternative explanations
   - maybe just coincidental
   - direction of connection\
      E1 causes E2 or E2 cause E1
   - other underlying cause\
      not E1 causes E2 or E2 causes E1\
      but E3 causes E1 and E2
3. Work around toward the most likely explanation
4. Expect complexity

-------

## Deductive Arguments

> There is no way to admit the truth of these premises but deny the conclusion.\
If its premises are true, the conclusion must be true too.

1. [*Modus ponens*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens)\
   If p then q. p. Therefore, q.
2. [*Modus tollens*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_tollens)\
   If p then q. Not q. Therefore, not p.
3. Hypothetical syllogism\
   If p then q. if q then r. Therefore, if p then r.
4. Disjunctive syllogism\
   p of q. Not p. Therefore, q.
5. Dilemma\
   p or q. If p then r. If q then s. Therefore, r or s.
6. [*Reductio ad absurdum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum)\
   To prove: p. Assume the opposite: Not-p.\
   Argue that from the assumption, we'd have to conclude: q.\
   Show that q is false (contradictory, "absurd" morally or unacceptable)\
   Conclude: p must be true after all.
7. Deductive arguments in several steps\
   Combine the above.

-------

## Extended Arguments

1. Explore the issue: take the time\
   Be ready to be surprised, e.g., to hear evidence & arguments for position you do not like.
2. Spell out basic ideas as arguments
3. Defend basic premises with arguments of their own.\
   (for those who don't known much about the basic premises)
4. Consider objections\
   What are the best arguments against the conclusion you are working on?
5. Consider alternatives\
   If you are defending a proposal, it is not enough to show that your proposal will solve a problem.\
   You must also show that it is better than other plausible ways of solving that same problem.

-------

## Argumentative Essays

1. Jump right in\
   Not: For centuries, philosophers have debate.\
   Just: Philosophers have debate.
2. Make a definite claim or proposal
3. Your argument is your outline
4. Detail objections and meet them
5. Get feedback and use it
6. Modesty, please!!

-------

## Oral Arguments

1. Reach out to your audience
2. Be fully present
3. Sign post your argument
4. Offer something positive
5. Use visual aids sparingly
6. End in style

-------

## Appendix I

Some common fallacies

- [*Ad hominem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem) ("to the person")\
  attacking the person of a source rather than his/her qualifications or reliability, or the actual argument
- [*Ad ignorantiam*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance) (appeal to ignorance)\
  arguing a claim is true just because it has not been shown to be false
- [*Ad misericordiam*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_pity) (appeal to pity)\
  appealing to pity as an argument for special treatment
- [*Ad popolum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum) ("appeal to the people")\
  appealing to the emotions of a crowd. "Everyone is doing it!!"
- Affirming the consequent\
  If p then q. q. Therefore, p.
- [Begging the question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question)\
  implicitly using your conclusion as a premise
- Circular argument\
  same as begging the question, in a bigger loop
- Complex question\
  Are you still as self-centered as you used to be?
- Denying the antecedent\
  a deductive mistake of the form\
  If p then q. Not p. Therefore, not q.
- Equivocation\
  sliding from one meaning of a term to another in the middle of an argument
- False cause
- False dilemma\
  reducing the options you consider to just two\
  E.g., "America: Love It or Leave It."
- Loaded language
- [*Non sequitur*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacy) (formal fallacy)\
  drawing a conclusion that "does not follow"
- Over generalizing
- Overlooking alternatives
- Persuasive definition\
  defining a term in a way that may seem to be straightforward, but in fact is loaded
- [*Petitio principii*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question) (begging the question)
- [Poisoning the well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_the_well)\
  using loaded language to disparage an argument before even mentioning it
- [*Post hoc, ergo propter hoc*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc) ("after this, therefore because of this")\
  assuming causation too readily on the basis of mere succession in time
- [Red herring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring)\
  introducing an irrelevant or secondary subject, thereby diverting from the main subject
- [Straw man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man)\
  a caricature of an opposing view, exaggerated from what anyone is likely to hold, so that it is easy to refute

## Appendix II

Before we can effectively argue about anything, we need an agree-upon idea of what we are arguing about.

1. When terms are unclear, get specific
2. When terms are contested, work from the clear cases
   - Includes all the things that the term clearly fits
   - Excludes all the things that the term clearly doesn't fit
   - Draws the plainest possible line somewhere in between and explain why it is there, not somewhere else
3. Definitions don't replace arguments
