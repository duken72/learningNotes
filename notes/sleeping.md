## The Basics

There are two factors determining wake and sleep:

- The circadian rhythm
- Adenosine - the sleep pressure

### The Circadian Rhythm

- The internal 24-hour clock within your brain sends signal to every other brain regions and every organ.
- This 24-hour tempo helps to determine your time to be awake, asleep, time for eating, drinking, moods, emotions, etc.
- The cycle is actually not exactly 24 hours, rather around 24 hours and 15 minutes, but is re-adjusted with daylight exposure.

### MY RHYTHM IS NOT YOUR RHYTHM

- Everyone has different respective peak and trough points in their rhythm.
- Around 40% are "Morning Larks", 30% are "Night Owls", and the rest 30% are somewhere in the middle.
- This is genetics, and they function optimally at different time of the day.

-------

### Melatonin

- This hormone of darkness regulate the timing of when sleep occurs. However, it doesn't actively generate sleep, it's just aiding.
- Once sleep is underway, melatonin slowly decreases across the night and into morning hours.
- For everyday you are in a different time zone, your suprachiasmatic nucleus can only re-adjust by about one hour

-------

### Adenosine

- Sleep pressure is measured by the amount of adenosine you have been accumulated while staying awake.

![Two factors regulating sleep](/notes/images/two-factors-regulating-sleep.png)
![The urge to sleep](/notes/images/the-urge-to-sleep.png)

-------

### Caffeine

- Caffeine occupies brain receptors, blocks the receptors' contact with adenosine, thus, the sleepiness.
- The "half-life" of caffeine is 5-7 hours in the body.\
  E.g.: If you have a cup of coffee around 7:30 p.m., by 1:30 a.m., 50% of that caffeine may still be active and circulating throughout your brain.
- People have different pace of removing caffeine from their bodies.
- When caffeine is in your system, adenosine continues to build up. Thus, when caffeine wears out, you will feel more sleepy.

-------

### AM I GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP?

An easy rule of thumb is to answer two simple questions (plus two extra ones):

- After waking up in the morning, could you fall back asleep at 10-11a.m.?\
  If the answer is “yes,” you are likely not getting sufficient sleep quantity and/or quality.
- Can you function optimally without caffeine before noon?\
  If the answer is “no,” then you are most likely self-medicating your state of chronic sleep deprivation.
- If you didn’t set an alarm clock, would you sleep past that time?\
  (If so, you need more sleep than you are giving yourself.)
- Do you find yourself at your computer screen reading and then rereading (and perhaps rereading again) the same sentence?

When you don’t get enough sleep, adenosine concentrations remain too high. Like an outstanding debt on a loan, come the morning, some quantity of yesterday’s adenosine remains. You then carry that outstanding sleepiness balance throughout the following day. This sleep debt will continue to accumulate. You cannot hide from it. The debt will roll over into the next payment cycle, and the next, and the next, producing a condition of prolonged, chronic sleep deprivation from one day to another.

-------

### NREM & REM

There are two stages/types of sleep:

|  | NREM | REM |
|---|---|---|
| Brain waves | Long-range, synchronous and reliable | Frantic, similar to attentive, alert wakefulness |
| Key functions | Memory refreshment | Strengthening neural connections |
|  | Clean up unnecessary neural connections | Create neural connections |
|  | Move short-term memory to long-term home | Increases our ability to recognize |
| Impact | Cognitive skills, reasoning, critical thinking | Problem-solving, fuzzy logic, creativity |

-------

### The Sleep Cycle

![The architecture of sleep](/notes/images/the-architecture-of-sleep.png)

- First half of the night, majority of the ninety-minute cycles are consumed by deep NREM sleep, and very little REM sleep.
- Second half of the night, it shifts: most of the time dominated by REM sleep, with little deep NREM sleep.
- E.g.: Assume your normal bedtime is at 12 a.m., and wake up at 8 a.m.
  - Both below cases, you lose 25% of the total sleep time
  - If you wake up at 6 a.m., you lose 60-90% of all your REM sleep.
  - If you don't sleep until 2 a.m., you lose a significant amount of deep NREM sleep instead.

-------

### Alcohol

- Is not a "sleep aid" but one of the most powerful suppressors of REM sleep.
- Doesn't induce natural sleep, rather takes away your consciousness and sedates you out of wakefulness.
- Fragments sleep and suppress REM sleep.

-------

### Sleep Pattern

| Monophasic pattern (modern) | Biphasic pattern (biological) |
|---|---|
| a single bout of slumber at night (average < 7 hours) | 7 hours of sleep + 30-60-minute afternoon nap |
| A distorted pattern resulted from modernization | Is not cultural in origin, but biological |
| E.g.: Increased risk of death from heart disease |  |

## Changes in Sleep Across the Life Span

### SLEEP BEFORE BIRTH

- Prior to birth, a human infant will spend most of its time in a sleep-like state.
- Arm flicks and leg bops are due to yet-to-construct body-paralyzing mechanism of REM sleep.
- The amount of REM sleep increase from around 6-12 hours throughout pregnancy time. In this phase, REM sleep overenthusiastic infuses the brain with masses of neural connections.

#### Autism

- There is possible link between REM sleep and ASD (autism spectrum disorder)
- Autistic children have weaker circadian rhythm
- There is a 30-50% shortage of REM sleep

#### Alcohol & Pregnancy

Newborns of heavy-drinking mothers:

- Did NOT have the same electrical quality of REM sleep.
- Had reduced the amount of time spent in REM sleep.
- Suffered a marked *depression in breathing* during REM sleep.

When babies consume alcohol-laced milk, they:

- Have more *fragmented* sleep
- Spend more time awake
- Suffer a *20-30% suppression of REM sleep* soon after.

-------

### CHILDHOOD SLEEP

- Infants and young kids display polyphasic sleep:
  - Many short snippets of sleep through the day and night
  - Punctuated by numerous awakenings, often vocal.
- The older a child gets, the fewer, longer, and more stable their sleep bouts become, due to the developing circadian rhythm.
- Not until 3-4 months age will a newborn show modest signs of being governed by a daily rhythm.
- By the one-year milestone, the suprachiasmatic nucleus clock of an infant has taken control over the circadian rhythm.
- The timeshare between NREM and REM sleep varies:
  - 50/50: 6-month-old infant
  - 70/30: 5-year-old child
  - 80/20: late teen years, early and mid-adulthood

-------

### SLEEP AND ADOLESCENCE

- In the first round (prior to birth, and soon after), the challenge for development was to build and add vast numbers of neural connections. REM sleep plays an essential role in this proliferation process.
- Then, the second round, re-modeling must take place with NREM sleep. This optimization process happens till mid-twenties.
- The circadian rhythm shifts:
  - Young children: shifts backward. They become sleepy earlier and wake up earlier than their adult parents.
  - Adolescent teenagers: during puberty, shifts progressively forward, passes even the timing of their adult parents.
  - E.g.:
    - A 9-year-old feels sleepy by around 9 p.m.
    - A 16-year-old is usually sleepy a few more hours after 9-10 p.m.
- Early school time fucks this up.

-------

### SLEEP IN MIDLIFE AND OLD AGE

- That older adults simply need less sleep is a myth.
- Older adults need just as much sleep as they do in midlife, but are simply less able to generate that still necessary sleep.
- The older we get, the more frequently we wake up throughout the night (causes including interacting medications, diseases, but mostly because of weakened bladder).
- The circadian timing shifts, leading to earlier bedtimes.
- Older adults may wish to consult with their doctor about taking melatonin in the evening.

-------

## Why Should You Sleep?

### Sleep and Learning

- Memory formed without sleep are weaker memories, evaporating rapidly.
- SLEEP-THE-NIGHT-BEFORE LEARNING
  - Refreshes ability to initially make new memories (including midday nap)
  - Relates to lighter, stage 2 NREM sleep. The concentration of NREM sleep spindles is especially rich in the late-morning hours, sandwiched between long periods of REM sleep.
  - Sleeping six hours or less will shortchange this learning restoration benefit.
- SLEEP-THE-NIGHT-AFTER LEARNING
  - During NREM sleep, the short-term memory repositories (of the hippocampus) move its data to the long-term home (within the cortex).
  - After this transition, you awake with both yesterday’s experiences safely filed away and having regained your short-term storage capacity for new learning throughout that following day.
- SLEEP TO FORGET?: NREM sleep helps to forget unnecessary parts as well.
- MUSCLE MEMORY: Practice makes perfect. Not so, it seemed. Perhaps it was practice, *with sleep*, that makes perfect?

-------

### Sleep Deprivation and the Brain

- Is extremely dangerous for driving.
- Swings excessively to both extremes of emotional valance (positive and negative), which, with high probability, l
- Lead to loss/reduction of rationality.
- In turn, this can lead to:
  - Bipolar disorder
  - Depression
  - Anxiety and suicidal thoughts/attempts
  - Aggression, bullying
  - Risk taking, addiction
- Patients with Alzheimer's disease have sleep disruption, impaired deep NREM sleep.

-------

### Sleep Deprivation and the Body

- Health:
  - Increased risk of developing and/or dying from coronary heart disease.
  - Shut off growth hormone—a great healer of the body—which normally surges at night.
  - More likely to eat more and become unable to manage those calories and blood sugar concentrations effectively.
  - Increase probability of gaining weight, being overweight or obese.
- Reproduction:
  - Men:
    - Lower sperm count
    - Sperm themselves with more deformities.
    - Significantly smaller testicles.
    - Low testosterone
  - Women:
    - Drop in follicular-releasing hormone
    - Abnormal menstrual cycles
    - probability of miscarriage
- Sleep fights against infection and sickness.
- When you're ill, the immune system actively stimulates the sleep system, demanding more bed rest.

-------

## Sleep and Modern Age

- Blue LED light harmfully suppresses nighttime melatonin.
- Woken by an alarm, people will suffer a spike in blood pressure and a shock acceleration in heart rate. This caused by an explosive burst of activity from the fight-or-flight instinct.

## Tips for Healthy Sleep

1. Stick to a sleep schedule
2. Exercise frequently is great, but not too late in the day. It increases total sleep time, especially deep NREM sleep, and shortens the time to fall asleep. It also deepens the quality of sleep.
3. Avoid caffeine and nicotine. Coffee, colas, certain teas, and chocolate contain the stimulant caffeine
4. Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed. It may help you relax, but heavy use robs you of REM sleep
5. Avoid large meals and beverages late at night as they might cause indigestion or frequent awakenings to urinate
6. If possible, avoid medicines that delay or disrupt your sleep
7. Don't take naps after 3 p.m. Late afternoon naps can make it harder to fall asleep at night
8. Relax before bed (reading, listening to music). Don't overschedule your day.
9. Take a hot bath before bed. The bath can help you relax and also drop in body temperature. Splashing water on your face, hands, or feet has similar effect.
10. Dark, cool, gadget-free bedroom.
11. Have the right sunlight exposure.
12. Don't lie in bed awake. If you find yourself still awake after staying in bed for more than twenty minutes, get up and do some relaxing activity until you feel sleepy.
